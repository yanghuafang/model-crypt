# tidy.sh — run clang-tidy over model-crypt's sources.
#
# Complements format.sh: clang-format fixes layout, clang-tidy fixes constructs.
# The check list lives in ../.clang-tidy, with the reasoning for what is
# deliberately disabled — including why the bugprone- and clang-analyzer-
# families ARE enabled here, which is unusual for a style configuration and is
# the point in a cryptographic library.
#
# Needs a compile database. CMakeLists sets CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS, so
# ./build.sh produces one; run a build first if the file is missing.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)   report findings; exit 1 if any
#   --fix       apply clang-tidy's automatic fixes in place, then re-format
#
# Both modes also exit 1 when clang-tidy could not analyze what it was asked to,
# which is a separate condition from "found something" — and the quieter of the
# two, which is why it is checked explicitly below rather than inferred from an
# empty stdout.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tidy.sh
#   ./tidy.sh --fix
#   ./tidy.sh ../src/crypt/decrypt.cc
